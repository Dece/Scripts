1. Start a console with admin rights (right click on start menu button).
2. Run Powershell if not already.
3. Ensure correct execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`
4. Run the scripts you want. "reg" files can be run and will set registry keys.
5. Reset execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned`
